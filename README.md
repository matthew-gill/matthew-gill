### Hey ✨

Senior Tech Lead and Software Engineer with experience in the Martech industry. Passionate about technology and Generative AI (earning myself the nickname of MattGPT!). Ten years of professional experience in software engineering teams, with the last 4 years as a hands-on Tech Lead. My main programming experience is using Symfony (PHP) and React (Typescript), but I am technology agnostic, preferring the right tool for the right job. I’m currently learning Go, Python and the NextJS framework. I enjoy fast paced, innovative environments, building PoCs and delivering quality, well tested features to production.
